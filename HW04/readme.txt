BUTTERCUP BRICKOUT OVERVIEW
------------------------------
This simple, mode 4 GBA game has a few rules and a single motive.

You are Buttercup, one of the Powerpuff Girls, and you have been angrily woken up this morning against your will. Frustrated, you decide to destroy the sun (and any stars like it) in an act contrary to your usual ethics. 

The motive is to destroy all of the sun "bricks" by bouncing the balls off of the paddle on the bottom of the screen and attempting to collide one of the four balls with a sun "brick." A collision between one of the balls and a single sun "brick" destroys that sun "brick." You lose if every ball falls below the paddle at the bottom of the screen. (NOTE: balls are NOT replenished in game!) You win (and get to fall back asleep) if you destroy all of the sun "bricks."


KEY INPUTS AND THE LIKE

The title screen is a tired, angry Buttercup. To go from the title screen to the game, press the START key.

ENCOURAGEMENT

Have fun, and destroy all the sun "bricks" to resume your peaceful (and clearly needed) sleep!
